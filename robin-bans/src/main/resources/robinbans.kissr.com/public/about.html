							Robin is an illustrator with over 20 years professional experience.
							<br>
							<br>
							Being a native of Glasgow, Robin has always drawn inspiration from the people and surroundings of his home town.
							Indeed many aspects of his artwork are often a reflection of the everyday humour and character you find in the city.
							<br>
							<br>
							His speciality over the years has been children's <a href="/books.html">book</a> illustration, children's <a href="/tv.html">TV</a> and animation storyboarding. 
							In addition he has a wide variety of published works which span from graphic design to landscape art.
							<br>
							<br>
							One of Robin's great pleasures is in working closely with individuals on personal commissions and projects. 
							Such projects have included <a href="/other.html">wedding</a> artwork compilations, cartoons, music band album cover design etc
							<br>
							<br>
							Over the years Robin has experimented with many different types of media which include watercolor, acrylics, pastels, spray paint, <a href src="other.html">computer</a> art, 
							anything in fact that will help achieve the desired effect. 
							<br>
							<br>
							So without further adieu, have a browse through the galleries and enjoy some of Robin's work.
